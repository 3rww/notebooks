    "## 1. The basics of getting gauge-adjusted radar rainfall data\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting rainfall data programmatically is a mostly straightforward endeavor: it requires you to submit a HTTP request with parameters specifying locations and a time range. It returns a `csv`-like plain-text response where time intervals are on the x-axis, locations are the y-axis, and values are rainfall amounts. Complete API documentation is available at [3rww.github.io/api-docs](https://3rww.github.io/api-docs/?language=Python#teragon-rainfall-dataset-api-10).\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge comes in formulating the location for this request. Location is specified with a \"pixel ID\", which translates to a location on a 1-kilometer grid set over Allegheny County, PA. The pixel (or pixels) is a required parameter; finding and entering those raw values is somewhat tedious.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the basics of making a call to the API, we'll first use some pre-selected pixel values; we'll demonstrate how to get pixel locations from geodata later on, and then revisit submitting the request for specific locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assemble the request payload\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the Python `requests` library to make our calls to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use Hurricane Ivan in 2004 as an example (2004-09-17 03:00 to 2004-09-18 00:00). The request payload for that event looks like this:"
